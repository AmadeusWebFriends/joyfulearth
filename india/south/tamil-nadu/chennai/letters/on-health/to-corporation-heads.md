## Current Waste Management Challenges in Chennai
Chennai, as one of India's largest metropolitan cities, faces significant challenges in waste management. Below are some key issues:

1. **Overflowing Landfills**: The city's landfills are nearing capacity, posing severe environmental and health risks.
2. **Consumerism and Food Industry Impact**: The rapid growth of consumerism and the food industry has led to an alarming increase in waste generation.
3. **Lack of Proper Waste Segregation**: Despite efforts, waste segregation at the source remains inadequate.
4. **Irresponsible Disposal Practices**: Many residents and pedestrians lack awareness or care about proper garbage disposal.
