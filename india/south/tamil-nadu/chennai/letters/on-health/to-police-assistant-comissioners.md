As you know, our city is full of motorists with a lot of stress leading to road rage. Noise pollution is at its peak and this only adds to the horrific situation.

We propose to once again sensitize

* Youngsters and their parent on road traffic management via policemen in workshops in schools.
* Proper driving habits to license holders when taking/renewing licenses.
* Have "do not horn" slogans in highly congested areas.
* Policemen STOP persons who horn and hand them our unique %AYUSH+% Destress Kits
