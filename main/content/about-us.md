Joyist International is a Chennai-based organization dedicated to promoting the positive energy of joy across various spheres of life. Our mission is to inspire collective influence and rejuvenate individuals and systems through transformative initiatives. Our work spans critical areas such as health, climate change, and socio-civic entrepreneurship, all aimed at fostering holistic well-being and sustainable development.

We are launching a unique, first-of-its-kind initiative, called &quot;**Fridays of Future**&quot; which aims to raise awareness among students in Chennai about the critical issue of climate change. This initiative seeks to mobilize young people to take preventive action against climate change. We plan to mobilize the youth in colleges and schools to connect with various stakeholders, including government authorities, to promote extensive greening and address pollution from sources like thermal power plants. The campaign also encourages students to engage with international leaders to advocate for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.
