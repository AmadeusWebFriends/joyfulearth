The climate change crisis menacing our planet is a very real and critical one demanding our attention and because of this the Chennai coastline is very vulnerable to get eroded or lost due to sea rise. Since the Marina Beach and adjoining areas are also part of the Bay of Bengal coastline, this area is prone to getting inundated in the next few decades.

The unscrupulous excessive burning of coal and other dangerous fossil fuels the past few decades has resulted in the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, which has led to drastically altering our climate and causing widespread environmental and health issues. The continued reliance on these fuels is accelerating global warming and its destructive effects.
